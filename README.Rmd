## About this app

This app was originally built by [Parker &
Leclerc](https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_tracker/#) to visualize
COVID-19 cases and deaths. What’s presented here is a conversion of
parts of it to a modularized `{golem}` framework by [Basil
Okola](https://github.com/bokola).


## Tech used in this app

+ The [`{golem}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) Framework was used to build the Shiny App backend.

+ The whole app is powered by [`{shiny}`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).

+ Data visualization is done with [`{ggplot2}`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), 
[`{leaflet}`](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet), and [`{plotly}`](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R)

+ The UI was built with [`Boostrap`](https://getbootstrap.com/)

+ Docker images for both [shinyproxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/) and [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) were built
+ A docker container image was pushed to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)
